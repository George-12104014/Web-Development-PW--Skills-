    Nesting operators in Emmet allow for the creation of nested structures in HTML and CSS code. These operators specify the relationship between elements and determine how they should be nested or grouped together. Here are two commonly used nesting operators in Emmet:<br>

1. Child operator (`>`): The child operator `>` is used to indicate that an element is a direct child of another element. It is placed between two elements to create a parent-child relationship. The child element is nested within the parent element, and it is typically indented for better readability.

Example:
```html
div>ul>li
```


<br>
2. Sibling operator (`+`): The sibling operator `+` is used to indicate that two elements are siblings or adjacent to each other. It is placed between two elements to create a sibling relationship. The sibling elements are placed next to each other without any nesting.

Example:
```html
div+p+span
```


By using nesting operators, developers can quickly generate complex nested structures without having to manually write each element and its corresponding parent-child relationship. Nesting improves code organization, readability, and makes it easier to understand the structure of the HTML or CSS code.
