    Self-closing tags, also known as void elements or empty elements, are HTML tags that do not require a closing tag. They are used for elements that do not contain any content or have no need for additional nested elements. Instead of using a separate opening and closing tag, self-closing tags are written as a single tag with a trailing slash before the closing angle bracket (`/>`).

Example of self-closing tags:
```html


Self-closing tags are commonly used for elements like images (`img`), horizontal rules (`hr`), line breaks (`br`), and input fields (`input`), among others. They provide a concise and standardized way to represent elements that do not contain any content or require a closing tag.

Regarding meta tags, they are special HTML tags used to provide metadata or additional information about a web page. Meta tags are placed within the `head` section of an HTML document and are not visible on the actual web page. They provide information to browsers, search engines, and other web services.

Some common uses of meta tags include:<br>

1. Page title: The `title tag defines the title of the web page, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.<br>

2. Character encoding: The `meta charset="..."` tag specifies the character encoding used in the web page, ensuring that the browser interprets and displays the text correctly.<br>

3. Description: The `meta name="description" content="..."` tag provides a concise summary or description of the web page's content. Search engines often use this information in search results.
<br>
4. Keywords: The `meta name="keywords" content="..."` tag specifies relevant keywords or phrases that are associated with the web page's content. While not widely used by search engines, it can still provide additional context.

Meta tags serve various purposes, such as improving search engine optimization (SEO), enhancing accessibility, specifying viewport settings for mobile devices, and more. They play a crucial role in providing additional information about the web page and optimizing its presentation across different platforms and services.
