    In HTML, tags, elements, and attributes are essential components that structure and define the content of a web page. Here's a brief explanation of each term along with relevant examples:

1. Tags: HTML tags are used to mark up and define the structure of the content on a web page. They are enclosed in angle brackets (`<>`) and come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The content is placed between these tags. For example, the `<h1>` tag is used to define a heading, while the `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph.

Example:
```
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

2. Elements: HTML elements consist of tags and the content between them. They represent different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, etc. Elements are the building blocks of a web page and can be nested within each other.

Example:
```
<h2>This is a subheading</h2>
<p>This is another paragraph with <strong>bold</strong> text.</p>
```

3. Attributes: HTML attributes provide additional information or modify the behavior of HTML elements. They are placed within the opening tag of an element and are made up of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (`=`). Common attributes include `src` (specifying the source of an image), `href` (specifying the destination of a link), and `class` (defining a CSS class for styling purposes).

Example:
```
<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit example.com</a>
<p class="highlighted">This paragraph has a custom class.</p>
```

These fundamental components of HTML work together to structure, define, and enhance the content of web pages.
