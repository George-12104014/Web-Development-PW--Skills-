    Here are three primary tags in HTML along with a brief explanation:<br>

1. `html`: The `<html>` tag is the root element of an HTML document. It encloses the entire HTML content and serves as the starting point for all other tags. This tag defines that the document is an HTML document. Inside the `<html>` tag, you will typically find the `<head>` and `<body>` tags.

Example:
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Metadata and document settings go here -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Visible content of the web page goes here -->
  </body>
</html><br>
```
2. `head`: The `<head>` tag is used to contain the metadata and document settings of an HTML page. It provides information about the document, such as the page title, character encoding, linked stylesheets, scripts, and more. The content within the `<head>` tag is not directly displayed on the web page itself but is used to provide instructions and information to the browser and search engines.

Example:
```html
<head>
  <title>My Web Page</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</head><br>
```

3. `body`: The `<body>` tag represents the main content area of an HTML document. It contains all the visible elements and content that are rendered in the browser window. This is where you typically include headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, and other elements that form the core of your web page's content.

Example:
```html
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
  <p>This is some text.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">
  <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit example.com</a>
</body>
```

These three primary tags form the basic structure of an HTML document, with `<html>` defining the root, `<head>` providing metadata, and `<body>` containing the visible content of the web page.
