    In HTML, heading comments are used to provide additional information about a section of code or to temporarily disable a specific piece of code without removing it entirely. These comments are written between `<!--` and `-->` tags and are not displayed in the browser. Heading comments are useful for developers to leave notes, explanations, or reminders within the HTML code, making it easier to understand and maintain the codebase. They serve as helpful markers, allowing developers to quickly locate and identify specific sections or troubleshoot any issues.
