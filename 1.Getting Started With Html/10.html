    Global attributes in HTML are attributes that can be used with any HTML element. They provide common functionality and behaviors that can be applied universally across different elements. Here are five commonly used global attributes:<br>

1. `class`: The `class` attribute is used to define one or more CSS classes for an element. It allows you to associate an element with a specific class or classes, which can be used for styling or JavaScript manipulation.

Example:
```html
div class="container">.../div>
p class="highlighted">.../p>
```
<br>
2. `id`: The `id` attribute provides a unique identifier for an element. It is used to uniquely identify an element within an HTML document. IDs are often used for JavaScript manipulation or to create anchor links that navigate to specific sections on a page.

Example:
```html
div id="header".../div>
a href="#section1">Go to Section 1/a>
```
<br>
3. `style`: The `style` attribute is used to apply inline CSS styles to an element. It allows you to directly specify CSS rules for an element, such as color, font, margin, etc.

Example:
```html
p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">This is a red paragraph with larger font size./p>
```
<br>
4. `title`: The `title` attribute provides additional information about an element. It is typically displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers over the element. The `title` attribute can be used to provide more details or a brief description of an element.

Example:
```html
img src="image.jpg" alt="An image" title="A beautiful landscape photo"
```
<br>
5. `data-*`: The `data-*` attributes allow you to store custom data or information within an element. These attributes are prefixed with "data-" followed by a specific name of your choice. They can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript and are useful for attaching additional data to an element.

Example:
```html
div data-user-id="123" data-username="john">.../div>
```

These global attributes can be applied to various HTML elements, allowing for consistent and flexible customization and behavior across different elements in an HTML document.
